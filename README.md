## OP15 OOS16 AnyKernel Build Notes

This section documents what was required to recover a bootable OP15 AnyKernel
after test builds started bootlooping.

### Known Good Target

- Device target: `OP15`
- OS target: `OOS16`
- Kernel version: `android16-6.12.23`
- KernelSU type: `KSUN`
- Known working KernelSU Next ref:
  `f1b64f440f3cd170e2a86d7816bef26fbdee1caa`
- Known working SUSFS ref:
  `7b3e90160043ffe844f3db34d8c7c57ff4789f53`
- Expected KSUN version in the ZIP name/logs: `33169`

### What Broke Boot

The failed AnyKernel builds were not caused by module signature changes.
The likely bootloop cause was that Droidspaces/RedMagic container configs were
added globally to `gki_defconfig`, so they were also applied to OP15.

These configs changed the OP15 kernel `Image` size and produced non-booting
AnyKernel ZIPs:

```text
CONFIG_NAMESPACES=y
CONFIG_IPC_NS=y
CONFIG_UTS_NS=y
CONFIG_USER_NS=y
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT=y
CONFIG_CGROUPS=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_PIDS=y
CONFIG_MEMCG=y
```

Do not apply those container/Droidspaces configs globally for OP15. If they are
needed later, gate them per-device and test with `fastboot boot` before
publishing a flashable release.

### What Was Needed For The Functional AnyKernel

- Restored the OP15 kernel patch flow to match the previously boot-tested
  WildKernels path.
- Removed dynamic KernelSU/SUSFS source edits that changed the final kernel
  `Image`.
- Removed the global Droidspaces/namespace/cgroup config injection from OP15.
- Kept automatic release publishing enabled.
- Kept the Droidspaces daemon/init as a separate KernelSU module ZIP.
- Kept the Droidspaces module files vendored locally under:
  `vendor/droidspaces-module`

The Droidspaces module must remain separate from the AnyKernel boot image. It
should be installed only after the OP15 kernel boots successfully.

### How To Trigger The OP15 Build

Use the workflow manually with:

```powershell
gh workflow run build-kernel-release.yml `
  --repo Coding-BR/OnePlus_KernelSU_SUSFS `
  --ref main `
  -f make_release=true `
  -f op_model=OP15
```

The workflow defaults are pinned to the known working KSUN and SUSFS refs above.
Do not pass malformed JSON through PowerShell for `ksu_options`; if custom JSON
is required, verify the run reaches the matrix generation step successfully.

### Validation Checklist Before Flashing

After the Action finishes:

- Confirm the release contains an `AK3_OP15_OOS16_android16-6.12.23_KSUN_33169`
  ZIP.
- Confirm the release also contains the separate
  `Droidspaces_Daemon_Init_KernelSU_OP15_OOS16_android16-6.12.23_KSUN_33169`
  ZIP when Droidspaces packaging is enabled.
- Extract the AK3 ZIP and compare the internal `Image` size with the known-good
  OP15 build. The recovered functional-size target was:

```text
Image size: 40974848 bytes
```

- A bad bootlooping build had a larger `Image`, around:

```text
41044480 bytes
41048576 bytes
```

- Flash/test the AK3 first.
- Install the Droidspaces KernelSU module only after Android boots.

### Unsigned `.ko` Driver Test Guide

Android GKI can load unsigned `.ko` modules only when signature enforcement is
not active and the module uses allowed KMI symbols. Unsigned support is not the
same thing as "load any driver".

For OP15 `android16-6.12.23`, the workflow disables `MODULE_SIG_FORCE` and
`MODULE_SIG_ALL` before `olddefconfig`, then validates the final `.config` and
fails the build if unsafe enforcement is found:

```text
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE=y
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL=y
module.sig_enforce=1
```

`CONFIG_MODULE_SIG=y` may still exist. That only enables module signature
support. It does not by itself force signed-only loading. The dangerous setting
for unsigned modules is `CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE=y`, runtime
`sig_enforce=Y`, or the boot parameter `module.sig_enforce=1`.

Runtime must still be checked on the phone that will load the module. On the
currently connected rooted test phone (`NX809J`, Android 16, running
`6.12.23-android16-OP-WILD`), the observed state was:

```text
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG=y
# CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE is not set
# CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL is not set
/sys/module/module/parameters/sig_enforce = N
/proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled = 0
```

This proves that this tested runtime was not enforcing signed-only modules. It
does not prove that every OP15/NX809J/Android 16 device is identical, and it
does not guarantee that an arbitrary driver works. Repeat the checks on the
target phone after booting the target kernel.

#### Confirm The Phone Is Ready

Run these commands from a computer with ADB access:

```sh
adb devices -l
adb shell su -c 'uname -a'
adb shell su -c 'zcat /proc/config.gz | grep MODULE_SIG'
adb shell su -c 'cat /sys/module/module/parameters/sig_enforce 2>/dev/null || echo no-sig-enforce-param'
adb shell su -c 'cat /proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled 2>/dev/null || echo no-modules-disabled-sysctl'
adb shell su -c 'grep -R "module.sig_enforce" /proc/cmdline /proc/bootconfig 2>/dev/null || true'
```

Expected safe result on the target phone:

```text
# CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE is not set
# CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL is not set
sig_enforce = N
modules_disabled = 0
no module.sig_enforce=1 in cmdline or bootconfig
```

If `sig_enforce=Y`, `CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE=y`, or `module.sig_enforce=1` is
present, unsigned `.ko` modules are expected to fail with a signature/key error.
If the phone is not the device the kernel was built for, stop and use the
correct kernel first.

#### Test A Driver Safely

Do not place a new driver in an auto-load path for the first test. Copy it to a
manual test directory and load it only after Android has fully booted.

```sh
adb push driver.ko /data/local/tmp/driver.ko
adb shell su -c 'chmod 0644 /data/local/tmp/driver.ko'
adb shell su -c 'modinfo /data/local/tmp/driver.ko'
adb shell su -c 'dmesg -C'
adb shell su -c 'insmod /data/local/tmp/driver.ko'
adb shell su -c 'dmesg | tail -n 120'
adb shell su -c 'cat /proc/modules | grep -w driver || true'
```

If the module loads and must be removed:

```sh
adb shell su -c 'rmmod driver'
adb shell su -c 'dmesg | tail -n 80'
```

Replace `driver` with the module name shown by `modinfo`, not necessarily the
file name.

#### Ways To Load A Driver

There are several ways to test or deploy a kernel driver. They do not all have
the same AVB/vbmeta requirements.

Manual runtime test:

- Location: `/data/local/tmp/driver.ko`
- Load method: `insmod /data/local/tmp/driver.ko`
- Needs root: yes
- Needs vbmeta changes: normally no
- Best use: first test, because it happens after Android has already booted.

KernelSU module:

- Location: usually under `/data/adb/modules/<module-name>/`
- Load method: module script runs `insmod`/`modprobe`
- Needs root: yes, through KernelSU
- Needs vbmeta changes: normally no
- Best use: repeatable loading after the manual test already worked.
- Risk: if the module loads too early and crashes the kernel, Android can
  bootloop until the KernelSU module is disabled or removed.

System/vendor DLKM partition:

- Location: `system_dlkm`, `vendor_dlkm`, or a related verified partition
- Load method: Android/vendor module loader or init scripts
- Needs root: yes
- Needs vbmeta changes: often yes, because these partitions are AVB verified
- Best use: permanent/vendor-style deployment after the module is proven safe.
- Risk: wrong module, wrong dependency order, or bad symbols can break boot.

Boot/vendor_boot/init_boot image:

- Location: packed into a boot-related image or ramdisk
- Load method: early boot script/init flow
- Needs vbmeta changes: often yes
- Best use: only when the driver must load very early.
- Risk: highest, because a bad module can prevent Android from booting.

#### AVB/vbmeta vs `.ko` Signature

AVB/vbmeta and kernel module signature are different checks.

Kernel module signature decides whether the running kernel accepts a `.ko` at
load time. For this, check `CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE`, `sig_enforce`, and
`module.sig_enforce`.

AVB/vbmeta decides whether Android accepts modified boot/system/vendor images
or verified partitions. For this, check bootloader state, vbmeta state, and
verity/verification state.

You normally do not need to disable vbmeta just to test:

```sh
adb push driver.ko /data/local/tmp/driver.ko
adb shell su -c 'insmod /data/local/tmp/driver.ko'
```

You may need vbmeta/verity changes if you modify or flash verified partitions
or images such as `vendor_dlkm`, `system_dlkm`, `boot`, `vendor_boot`,
`init_boot`, or `dtbo`.

The commands used for this vbmeta/verity path are device- and slot-sensitive.
Use only when you intentionally want to flash modified verified images:

```sh
fastboot --disable-verity flash vbmeta_a vbmeta.img
fastboot --disable-verity flash vbmeta_b vbmeta.img
fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta_system_a vbmeta_system.img
fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta_system_b vbmeta_system.img
```

Important:

- These commands are not required for a simple `/data/local/tmp` `insmod` test.
- Use the vbmeta images that match the exact firmware/device/slot layout.
- Disabling verification can reduce device security and can cause boot failure
  if the wrong image is flashed.
- Keep a known-good boot/recovery path before modifying verified images.

#### How To Read `dmesg`

These messages mean the unsigned module path is working, but the kernel is
marking itself as tainted because the module is external and unsigned:

```text
module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel
Tainted: [O]=OOT_MODULE, [E]=UNSIGNED_MODULE
```

This message normally means signature enforcement is still blocking the module:

```text
Required key not available
```

These messages mean the module is not compatible with this kernel/KMI and must
be rebuilt or fixed:

```text
Unknown symbol ... (err -2)
disagrees about version of symbol ...
invalid module format
vermagic ...
```

Common causes:

- `vermagic` mismatch: rebuild the module for the exact running kernel.
- unknown symbol/KMI error: the driver uses symbols not exported through the
  allowed GKI KMI surface.
- architecture mismatch: rebuild as `arm64/aarch64`.
- dependency missing: load the required dependency module first.

#### What Is And Is Not Supported

Supported:

- manually testing an unsigned `.ko` after Android boots.
- loading a compatible unsigned module when `sig_enforce=N`.
- diagnosing failures through `dmesg`.

Not supported:

- loading any random `.ko` regardless of KMI or symbols.
- bypassing AVB/vbmeta/bootloader verification with this setting.
- auto-loading an untested module during boot.
- treating `CONFIG_MODULE_SIG=y` as a failure by itself.
