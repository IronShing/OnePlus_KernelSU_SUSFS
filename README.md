## OP15 OOS16 AnyKernel Build Notes

This section documents what was required to recover a bootable OP15 AnyKernel
after test builds started bootlooping.

### Known Good Target

- Device target: `OP15`
- OS target: `OOS16`
- Kernel version: `android16-6.12.23`
- KernelSU type: `KSUN`
- Known working KernelSU Next ref:
  `f1b64f440f3cd170e2a86d7816bef26fbdee1caa`
- Known working SUSFS ref:
  `7b3e90160043ffe844f3db34d8c7c57ff4789f53`
- Expected KSUN version in the ZIP name/logs: `33169`

### What Broke Boot

The failed AnyKernel builds were not caused by module signature changes.
The likely bootloop cause was that Droidspaces/RedMagic container configs were
added globally to `gki_defconfig`, so they were also applied to OP15.

These configs changed the OP15 kernel `Image` size and produced non-booting
AnyKernel ZIPs:

```text
CONFIG_NAMESPACES=y
CONFIG_IPC_NS=y
CONFIG_UTS_NS=y
CONFIG_USER_NS=y
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT=y
CONFIG_CGROUPS=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_PIDS=y
CONFIG_MEMCG=y
```

Do not apply those container/Droidspaces configs globally for OP15. If they are
needed later, gate them per-device and test with `fastboot boot` before
publishing a flashable release.

### What Was Needed For The Functional AnyKernel

- Restored the OP15 kernel patch flow to match the previously boot-tested
  WildKernels path.
- Removed dynamic KernelSU/SUSFS source edits that changed the final kernel
  `Image`.
- Removed the global Droidspaces/namespace/cgroup config injection from OP15.
- Kept automatic release publishing enabled.
- Kept the Droidspaces daemon/init as a separate KernelSU module ZIP.
- Kept the Droidspaces module files vendored locally under:
  `vendor/droidspaces-module`

The Droidspaces module must remain separate from the AnyKernel boot image. It
should be installed only after the OP15 kernel boots successfully.

### How To Trigger The OP15 Build

Use the workflow manually with:

```powershell
gh workflow run build-kernel-release.yml `
  --repo Coding-BR/OnePlus_KernelSU_SUSFS `
  --ref main `
  -f make_release=true `
  -f op_model=OP15
```

The workflow defaults are pinned to the known working KSUN and SUSFS refs above.
Do not pass malformed JSON through PowerShell for `ksu_options`; if custom JSON
is required, verify the run reaches the matrix generation step successfully.

### Validation Checklist Before Flashing

After the Action finishes:

- Confirm the release contains an `AK3_OP15_OOS16_android16-6.12.23_KSUN_33169`
  ZIP.
- Confirm the release also contains the separate
  `Droidspaces_Daemon_Init_KernelSU_OP15_OOS16_android16-6.12.23_KSUN_33169`
  ZIP when Droidspaces packaging is enabled.
- Extract the AK3 ZIP and compare the internal `Image` size with the known-good
  OP15 build. The recovered functional-size target was:

```text
Image size: 40974848 bytes
```

- A bad bootlooping build had a larger `Image`, around:

```text
41044480 bytes
41048576 bytes
```

- Flash/test the AK3 first.
- Install the Droidspaces KernelSU module only after Android boots.

### Latest Recovery Reference

The recovery build that removed the global Droidspaces configs was generated
from:

```text
Commit: 2ed51cf fix(op15): stop applying droidspaces configs globally
Run:    27830882926
AK3:    AK3_OP15_OOS16_android16-6.12.23_KSUN_33169_SuSFS_v2.1.0.zip
